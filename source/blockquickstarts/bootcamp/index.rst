In this series of quickstart tutorials, you’ll learn the rudiments of working with the Ninja Platform. They are consise, and as such make some assumptions. We assume you have a Ninja Account and that you know some JavaScript/(other languages to come).

Get your devices
---------

Use the Node.js library to command your block to output a JSON representation of all of its connected devices.

  :ref:`Commence the lesson <getyourdevices>` 

Work with Sensor Readings
---------

Drill down to a specific device and extract its data.

  :ref:`Commence the lesson <workwithsensorreadings>` 

Send Commands to Devices
---------

Learn how to set the value of a device with the ‘actuate’ method.

  :ref:`Commence the lesson <sendcommands>` 

Deploy a basic Web App
---------

Use our provided script to create and deploy a bare-bones app to our hosting site of choice, heroku. This is a vital quickstart to master if you haven’t already, as it will give you the ability to run your apps in the cloud, as well implement RESTful routes. (Not to mention subscribe to device feeds, as in the next quickstart.)

Subscribe to Device Feeds
---------

Learn how to setup callbacks from devices to be notified when their data changes.

  :ref:`Commence the lesson <subscribetodevicefeeds>` 

Work with Subdevices
---------

Understand how to interact with second class devices such as RF433 sensors and actuators

  :ref:`Commence the lesson <workwithsubdevices>` 

Hello Ninja
---------

This quickstart ties together all of the lessons you learned in Ninja Bootcamp thus far and shows you how to set the value of a actuator device based on the value of another device.
