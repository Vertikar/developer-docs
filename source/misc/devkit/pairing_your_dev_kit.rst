Pairing your developer kit
==========================

Visit ``http://ninjasphere`` or ``http://<your devkit ip>`` in your web browser. Since the Dev Kit is not yet activated with the Ninja Sphere Cloud, it will redirect you to the cloud.

Create an account
-----------------

If you haven't paired a Dev Kit to the new Ninja Cloud before, you will now need to create an account. Note that this is a completely different identity to the one used with the existing Ninja Blocks platform.

You should see the following screen:

Tap the "sign up" link at the bottom of the screen and you should see a sign up page:

Enter your name, a valid email address and a password, then click allow.

Pair using your serial number
-----------------------------

You will now see a screen asking you to enter a serial number. Your Dev Kit has a unique serial number, allowing us to identify it.

Enter this serial number in the box and follow the on-screen instructions to get back to your Dev Kit.

Once completed, you will now be on your local Dev Kit's web interface. You can get back to this at any time by visiting ``http://ninjasphere`` or ``http://<your devkit ip>``. This page would be a good idea to bookmark, since you'll want to get back there regularly as you use your Dev Kit.
