Resetting your Sphere
=====================

1. Hold down the button on the base of the sphere until the LED matrix changes to desired color (Grey, Green, Yellow, or Red)
    * Grey - Device Halt
	* Green - Device Restart
	* Yellow - Unpair Device
	* Red - Factory Reset - Only use when instructed by support staff. If interrupted, this may cause damage to your device.

2. Release the reset button. If you decide to cancel the selected action after releasing the button you have a small amount of time to cancel the action by pressing the button again while the selected colour fades. The LED matrix should flash white to indicate that the action has, indeed, been cancelled.

3. For a factory reset, be patient! This process may take about 20 minutes to complete.

4. After Reset, you may need to repeat the steps in `Configure Your Sphere </introduction/>`_

The 'Grey' and 'Green' resets are not destructive. The 'Yellow' and 'Red' resets will erase certain configuration from your sphere.

Note: that the documentation here reflects a software update released on March 10, 2015. Earlier versions of the Ninja Sphere runtime did not support the "Grey" (Device Halt) mode.
