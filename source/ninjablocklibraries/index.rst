Ninja Blocks Apps
---------
 
Want to build apps that talk to sensors and actuators in the real world? The Ninja Blocks apps platform lets you do just that! Using our RESTful API for Atoms™ you can build apps that can automate homes, monitor the environment and add other kinds of new functionality. You can do all this without needing to know embedded electronics, programming or networking.

Below you’ll find tutorials, example apps and libraries that will teach you how to create apps that talk to the Ninja Blocks Platform as well as and reference documentation for all the moving parts.
