Site
====

A house or building where one or more Ninja devices are installed, e.g. *Home at 123 Fake St*.

Currently a single site is automatically created, and the onboarding flow in the mobile applications sets the name and location of the site.

Example Site as exposed by the REST API:

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
		"id": "4a521b3c-b156-11e4-b196-3c15c2c1b774",
		"name": "Home",
		"type": "home"
	}
